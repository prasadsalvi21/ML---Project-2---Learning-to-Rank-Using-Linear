For this project, we would like to solve the Learning to Rank (LeToR) problem such that we take
a categorical target variable (t=[0,1,2]) and map our input vector x, features used to decipher the
ranking, to a real valued scalar target y(x,w) using linear regression. For two datasets, one real
data (LeTOR) and one synthetic data, we will predict the weights, error (cost function), using
both a closed form solution and stochastic gradient descent.
